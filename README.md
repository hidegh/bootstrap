## THIS IS A FORK
of https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap

Reason i've created: to **extend the original BS** with new feature branches.

### feature/offside-canvas-unobtrusive
Allows you to create manu that slides/pushes in from left/right or to create a multi panel sliding container (first 5 are configured inside css).
Try out the: https://github.com/hidegh/bootstrap/tree/feature/offside-canvas-unobtrusive/tests/offside/offside-test.html example.
If you like it, go to the original repo (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) find my pull request and give a +1.
